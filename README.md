# OpenRES
OpenRES is an open-source library of intermittent energy resources developed in the JModelica.org platform and built upon OpenIPSL, and provides capability for performing long-term time-domain simulation of electric power grids with renewable ancillary services (e.g., load ramp, frequency and voltage regulation) needed to mitigate the impact of variability on the bulk electric grid.
